# LinkedUProject

As a final project in the first semester of MS-Information Systems program (Web Development Specialization) at Illinois State University, I had developed the web application in a team of 4 under supervision of Dr. Billy Lim.
This web application provides a common platform to students and universities where students can create their account and share their academic records with the universities. In the similar way, universities can create their account and share their admission criteria with students.
Functionalities like account creation, document upload, document download, profile update, compare universities, schedule an appointment, additional information (through XML file), apply to the universities, password recovery etc. can be utilized by this web application. Moreover, we have used BootStrap3.0 at front-end to make this application responsive to any device like tablet, mobile, desktop etc.
Web development technologies like HTML, CSS, XML, JavaScript, JQuery, JSF, AJAX, Web Services, BootStrap3.0 etc. are used in the development process of this web application. Moreover, Derby DB database was used in the back-end.
